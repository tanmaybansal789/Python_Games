```ModernGL Voxel Renderer```
A minecraft renderer that uses moderngl, moderngl-window, PyGLM, PIL and Numba.

It is based off of another similar one I saw by 
https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/Minecraft

You move around with wasdeq, place/remove blocks with m/left click, change block interaction mode with space, and change block placing type with x.

```donut.py```

Makes a donut in the terminal. Uses numba no-python just in time compilation.
The original code in JavaScript/C: https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html

```snake.py```

An abomination. It is a very basic snake game in 24 lines because I thought it would be funny :)

```tile_slider.py```

Allows you to play that tile sliding game to order the numbers correctly.
Has a "scramble" button and a "solve" button that uses greedy best-first search.

```tkinter_2048.py```

A really old program that allows you to play 2048 using tkinter (arrow keys). It has sliding animations for tiles, but it is very badly written. It has functionality to use mouse/drag if using touchscreen computer.

```tkinter_3d_renderer_v2.py``` 

Another old badly written program that creates a basic 3d renderer with a tkinter canvas. You can add/remove objects with position, rotation and scale, as well as importing stls (this runs super slow). You move around with click and drag mouse for camera, as well as using wasd, shift and space for moving around.

```tkinter_tetris_2.py```

A simple implementation of tetris in tkinter that follows SRS.
